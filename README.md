Lab Instructions
---------------------
Change the Main file so that test() returns 5.

How to Edit
---------------------
You can edit this assignment in https://repl.it or use Bluej.  Instructions for both are below.

Using either environment, when you commit and push the assignment, it will update your github repository.
It will also autograde it using the TestMain program so you can see if it worked.  You should see a green check mark on the github page it if succeeded.

(You should always do commit and push together.  They are only useful in separate steps if you are working on a big project with multiple people.)

How to use with Bluej
---------------------
1. Select and copy the URL of this repository
2. In Bluej, under Tools-->Team-->Checkout Project, click on the Git tab
3. Paste the URL into Repository URI
4. Fill in Personal information and click OK
5. Pick a Name for your project and a Location and click OK
6. In this Bluej project that was just created, make whatever changes you want
7. When you are finished, click on Tools-->Team-->Commit/Push Files to Repository
8. Type a Commit comment and click on Commit
9. Click on Push

How to use with Repl.it
------------------------
Go to your code repository in GitHub. Scroll down towards the bottom of the screen. 
Click the Work in Repl.it button. It will take awhile to load.

BUG ALERT: You will probably get an error page after the first click.  I have reported this bug.  
To work around it, press the back button and press the Work in Repl.it button again.
You still might need to wait awhile for it to load but it usually works on the second time.

You can now edit your code in Repl.it. 
Click the Run button to run your code. The black output screen will show the output that is run or will notify you of any errors.
When you are done with your code, click on the "Version Control" tab on left side of your screen. 
Write a few words describing what you changed and then click commit&push.
